                    Homemaker & Companion Care focuses on non-medical support services our Home Health Aides provide.
                    These supportive services help seniors continue living independently in their own homes while
                    receiving the assistance they need with daily tasks. When recovering from illness, managing
                    age-related challenges, or simply needing extra support, having caring professionals assist with
                    household tasks and provide companionship can significantly improve recovery time, boost confidence,
                    and enhance overall well-being.
