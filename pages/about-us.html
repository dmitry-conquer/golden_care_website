                    For people in search of <a href="#">personal care or companionship</a> for a loved one, home care is
                    the best way for many patients to preserve their independence and remain in the comfort of their own
                    homes. Whether you are an older adult who suffers from a chronic condition or even just
                    transitioning home from a hospital visit, home care can be a viable and affordable option for you or
                    your loved ones
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Virtually every personal care or aide service that a hospital, assisted living facility or nursing
                    home may offer can now be provided in the comfort and privacy of your home. Because of this, more
                    and more people are looking to spend their resources for care at home versus moving into a facility.
