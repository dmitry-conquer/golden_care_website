                <h2>Common Disabilities Among Veteransp</h2>
                <p>
                  Veterans often suffer disabilities that can make it difficult for them to function, leading to a need
                  for home care services in Naples. Common disabilities include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder: Soldiers who are traumatized in service may continue to relive
                    unpleasant incidents through flashbacks and nightmares. For some, the condition can be debilitating.
                    A caregiver can help by ensuring a safe and supportive home environment.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Hearing Loss: Veterans often suffer hearing loss due to exposure to gunshots and explosions. While
                    this condition does not necessarily require home care, a skilled caregiver may be needed if hearing
                    loss is combined with other disabilities. The aide will know how to communicate effectively.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Physical Disabilities: Individuals in service may become physically injured and suffer from
                    amputations, strains, and nerve damage, making it difficult to perform daily tasks. A home aide
                    offers various services that ensure a safe and hygienic environment for former military members.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Chronic Health Conditions: Chronic health conditions, like heart disease, diabetes, and cancer,
                    are common among veterans due to deployment-related exposures, socioeconomic factors, and lifestyle
                    choices. A home aide can oversee basic needs, medication management, and essential healthcare.
                  </li>
